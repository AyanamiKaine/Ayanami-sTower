## Local Install

### 1. Install vsce

First, you need to install vsce globally using npm (the Node.js package manager). If you don't have Node.js and npm installed, you'll need to do that first from the official Node.js website.

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```Bash
npm install -g vsce
```

This will install the vsce command-line tool on your system, making it available from any directory.

### 2. Run vsce
