# Stella Invicta (Prototype 4)

-   Let's see how many prototypes we need to implement before I commit to something.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run main.js
```

To run tests always when something changes:

```bash
bun test --watch
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.17. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
