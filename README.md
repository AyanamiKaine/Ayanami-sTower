## Monorepo of Ayanami

## Short Summary
- The main idea behind this monorepo is the creation of software capital
- Applications dont refrence other applications (no inter-dependency between them)
- Applications have longer english like names
- Packages have short prefix names, like svc (Svelte Components)
- Packages are cohesive bundeling of similar components.
- Components (files in packages) are prefixed with the package name.
- A flat hierarchy is preferred
- Reuse is encouraged.

## Why a Monorepo?

To facicilate reuse between projects. Not only for reuse between same languages but also for reuse of patterns across languages.
