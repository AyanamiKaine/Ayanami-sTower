## Stella Testing

## Why Another Testing-Framework?

Simple, I wanted to write my tests right next to the implementation, now I can write the test methods besides the implemenation method or create a test_class.cs and write them there. With the ability to simply call `StellaTesting.RunTests()`. I personally use this (C# REPL)[https://github.com/waf/CSharpRepl] and having the ability to run all tests in the REPL is quite powerful.

- No Dependency on Visual-Studio
- No Stupid Test Runner
- Simple function call to run tests.
