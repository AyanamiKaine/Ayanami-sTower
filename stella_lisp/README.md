# Stella Lisp

I see Stella Lisp as a programming language that compiles to C, and makes it much more easier to use C. The generated C code should formostly be readable. No fancy being to smart for my own good things should happen.

## The goal

The main goal is, it should be easier to create multiple programs that can interact with each other using message passing.

### TODO:
- [] Produce a workable Hello, World
- [] Make it possible to easily use different compilers
