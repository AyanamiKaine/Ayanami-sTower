# Dynamic Typing Performance

C# has the dynamic type, its use to avoid static type checking and doing it instead at runtime. Its said to only use it for interop of dynamic languages like python. I dont like this. Can we use the dynamic type extensively?. How big would the performance hit be? Does the JIT help?
