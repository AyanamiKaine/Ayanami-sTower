# Script Manager

C# has incredible scripting potential but lacks some tooling support. Also this script manager is ment to work with `Flecs.Net` where script have automatic access to the ECS World. For example debugging a script at runtime is not that easy and autocompletion not working, all warnings generated by the language server being wrong etc.

## Features

- Add, Update, Delete script at runtime
