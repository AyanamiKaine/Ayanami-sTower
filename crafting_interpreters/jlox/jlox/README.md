# Jlox not done in Java but better Java i.e C#!

- It was too late when I realized the J stands for Java...

## What is Implemented

- tokens and lexing,
- abstract syntax trees,
- recursive descent parsing,
- prefix and infix expressions,
- runtime representation of objects,
- interpreting code using the Visitor pattern,
- lexical scope, environment chains for storing variables,
- control flow, functions with parameters,
- closures, static variable resolution and error detection,
- classes,
- constructors,
- fields, methods,
- and finally inheritance.

With that the entire lox language specification is completely implemented as a tree-walking interpreter written in C# instead of Java.
