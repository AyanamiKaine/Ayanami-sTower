# TLDR

- The package manager will create a ./lib folder in your fennel project and will put there all needed libraries
- Packages will only be local to the project itself
- No Global Packages. (For Now)

# How to Use

- `fennel_pkg install PACKAGE_NAME`
    - installs the package in the working directory.


# TODO

- Create a flutter GUI

# Requirements

- (or (>= Lua 5.1) (= luajit))
