## Avalonia.Flecs.DebugWindow
Problem: Its unclear what entities currently exist, what name they have, what relations they have and which components are currently attached to them.

## Later Features
- Not only would it be nice to view entities but also to manipulate them easily with a gui. Adding components, changing component data, etc
