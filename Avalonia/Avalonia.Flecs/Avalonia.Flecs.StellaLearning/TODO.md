# TODO (Things that must be done)

## Enable a way to edit items (DONE)

### Problem

Currently items cannot be edited onces created, being able to change wrong information is crucial. Also we need a really nice user interface to change the priority of items, like being able to drage items above or below an existing one showing the relationship of priorities.

### Solution

Should be straight forward, creat edit windows. And a way to easily change priority using drag and drop logic in a list.

## Tag System (DONE)

### Problem

Currently spaced repetition items have the ability to holds tags. But there is no way to query items after defined tag.

### Solution

Either show tags in the spaced repetition list, simply make it possible to search by them in the search bar or something else I dont know yet.

### Implemented Solution

Tags are implemented for spaced repetition items, and can be used to search for items with specific tags

## Implemented a application wide tag system

### Problem

Currently the tag system was specificly created for spaced repetition items. We want to expand that idea to an application wide tag system that can be reused for everything that needs tags.
