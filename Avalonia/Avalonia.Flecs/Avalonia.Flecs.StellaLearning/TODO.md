# TODO (Things that must be done)

## Enable a way to edit items

### Problem

Currently items cannot be edited onces created, being able to change wrong information is crucial. Also we need a really nice user interface to change the priority of items, like being able to drage items above or below an existing one showing the relationship of priorities.

### Solution

Should be straight forward, creat edit windows. And a way to easily change priority using drag and drop logic in a list.
