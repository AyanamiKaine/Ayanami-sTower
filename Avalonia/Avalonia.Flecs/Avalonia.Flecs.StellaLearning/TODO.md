# TODO (Things that must be done)

## Enable a way to edit items

### Problem

Currently items cannot be edited onces created, being able to change wrong information is crucial. Also we need a really nice user interface to change the priority of items, like being able to drage items above or below an existing one showing the relationship of priorities.

### Solution

Should be straight forward, creat edit windows. And a way to easily change priority using drag and drop logic in a list.

## Tag System

### Problem

Currently spaced repetition items have the ability to holds tags. But there is no way to query items after defined tag.

### Solution

Either show tags in the spaced repetition list, simply make it possible to search by them in the search bar or something else I dont know yet.
