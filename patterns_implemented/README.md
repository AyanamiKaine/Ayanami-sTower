## Patterns Implemented
- A collection of patterns and their explanations to understand/use them.
- Many design patterns are grounded in OOP languages (Often to overcome their limitations of OPP itself)

## Short Summary
- Observer Design Pattern -> When you want to decouple a one-to-many relationship
- Strategy Design Pattern -> When you want to encapsulate/decouple a family of similar algorithms (Its an example of designing against an interface and not an implementation)

## Why even use design patterns?
- When you look online, there seems to be some trend to bash/hate design patterns, here are some examples "Me, after 7 years as a developer: What's a "design pattern"?"
- Design Patterns provide a consistend way to express a solution to a specifc problem. Dont reinvent the wheel where it is not necessary.
- Just dont implement design patterns for the sake of design patterns (i.e. overusing them)
- Consider design patterns as a tool to solve a design problem, not as a goal. 
- Be aware that design patterns are not limited to object-oriented programming. 
- Bear in mind that design patterns are not limited to dynamic polymorphism. 
- Understand that design patterns are not language-specific idioms.

## Design Pattern Misconceptions
- However, just as it’s important to understand what a design pattern is, it’s important to understand what a design pattern is not. Unfortunately, there are several common misconceptions about design patterns:
- Some consider design patterns as a goal and as a guarantee for achieving good software quality. 
- Some argue that design patterns are based on a particular implementation and thus are language-specific idioms. 
- Some say that design patterns are limited to object-oriented programming and dynamic polymorphism. 
- Some consider design patterns outdated or even obsolete.

## Design Pattern and Relation to Functional Programming
- It might be suprising but functional programming techniques can reduce the need to use a design pattern completely transformation abstract interface, class indirection to functional techniques like using lambdas, map reduce, higher-order functions, etc.

## TODO
- [ ] Add abstract examples
- [ ] Add concrete examples
- [ ] Adding Alternative Functional Approaches
