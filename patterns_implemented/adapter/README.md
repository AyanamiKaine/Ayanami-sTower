## Adapter Design Pattern 
- Converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients expect.
- Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise of incompatible interfaces.


## Use Case
- **Legacy Code Integration**
    - You have a useful legacy component, but its interface doesnt align with the rest of your modern system. An adapter lets you use it without modifying the legacy code. 
- **Third-Party Libraries**
    - You want to use a library with a greate feature set, but its interface doesnt quite fit into your architecture. The Adapter smoothes out this incompatibility 
- **Abstracting Different Vendors**
    - Your system needs to work with products from multiple vendors that provide similar features but with differing interfaces. Adapters create a unified interface to use these different products.
