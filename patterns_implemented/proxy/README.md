## Proxy Design Pattern
- Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another objet to control access to it.
- Wraps another object and provides a different interface to it.

## Use Cases
- Use the Proxy pattern to create a representative object that controls access to another object, which **may be remote**, **expensive to create**, or in need of **securing**.
    - Remote Proxy for accessing a remote object
    - Virutal Proxy for accessing a resource that is expensive to create.
    - Protection Proxy for accessing a resource based on access rights.
