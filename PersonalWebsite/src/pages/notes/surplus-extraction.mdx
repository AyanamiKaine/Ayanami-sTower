Surplus extraction happens by the elites. They extract the surplus created by labors. Should the average income of the elites decrease the elites will try to increase the current extraction rate. They do this economically and extraeconomic.

Sometimes they will also try to cut into subsistence resources that are needed to grow or maintain a population, resulting in negative growth of the population.

How much of more extraction can actually be done is mostly determined by structural factors. Has the elite a tight gripe on the society?
