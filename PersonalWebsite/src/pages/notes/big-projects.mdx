Big projects succeed if they are modular in completion. Wdym? When you built a project to 50% completion it should have around 50% value output. When building a wind park to 50% completion it should produce 50% energy of the overall wind park energy output.

Should a project only output something when its 100% completed, it often stalls, cost more, etc.

This is one reason why using existing libraries in programming is such a good idea. When using an existing library you already get something working fast. It also shows a common problem of using existing solutions. Often you will notice how existing solutions like a game engine or programming language. Gets you 80% the way of completion but something blocking the rest.

In video game development some games need to heavily modify an existing engine to mold it to their problem. I believe this is always a better option then starting from scratch. Because while you won't get the perfect solution it gets you fast to a state where you can provide actually value by the thing you created.

While I personally hate, bugs, crashes, corruptions, etc. Especially in paradox games, I would find it sad if they would be scrapped or put away for many years/months. They give 80% of the output (Where 100% would be a bug free and perfectly design game).
