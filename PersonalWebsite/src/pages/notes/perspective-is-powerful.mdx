Having different perspectives on things is probably the most powerful thing you can have. My Favorite example of this is [Alan Kay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay). While he is more know for his work at Xerox Park helping to invent the GUI and Smalltalk.

The lesser part known about him is that his bachelor was in Biology. This is the reason why he wanted to bring messages and the concept of cells that react to them to programming. Cells have a form of message queues built in them. Cells can react to change, adapt and transform.

Stem cells are the origin of all cells like a prototype blueprint that gets used to create more specific cells.

His perspective on Biology and living things greatly influence his ideas he wanted to bring to programming. In his mind software was more alive than it is now.
