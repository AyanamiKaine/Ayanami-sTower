The poor get poorer while the rich get richer. 

In a scenario where the average income of elites goes down. This decline is not the same for all elites. Some elites are poorer than others. The "poorer" elites cant sustain their current [living standard](/notes/living-standard) and needing to take on debts and later sell some of their wealth. While richer elites can still sustain their current living standards and profit from the sellout of poorer elites.

Here the rich elites profit from the sellout below value of the poorer elites.
