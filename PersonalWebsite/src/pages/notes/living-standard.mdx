The living standard can be seen as the average consumption that is relatively to the average consumption of their parents. It seems that people see their desired living standard as at least the same as their parents plus some more.

*In general people want to consume slightly more than their parents before.*

This relation results in people reacting much higher to a decrease of a standard of living then to an increase. An increase is expected over generations but a decrease not.
