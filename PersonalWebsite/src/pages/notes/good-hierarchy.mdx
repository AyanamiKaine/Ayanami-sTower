What makes a hierarchy good? A hierarchy is only good when it helps to facilitate communication between lower modules. This is the whole purpose of a higher level module. It bridges the gap between lower modules. 

If you create a higher level module that does not help the lower ones working together and doing their job then your manager is doing something wrong. Wait are we still talking about programming?
