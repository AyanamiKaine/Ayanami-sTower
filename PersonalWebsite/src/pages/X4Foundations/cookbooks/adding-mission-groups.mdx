This guide explains how to create and use Mission Groups in X4 Foundations mods. Mission groups allow you to display a group title above your missions (like "Kingdom End" or "Hatikvah" in the base game).

## Overview

Mission groups are displayed as a header above missions in the player's mission log and offer screens. This helps organize related missions under a common storyline or theme.

## Step 1: Define the Group Text

First, add text entries for your group name in your text file (`t/0001.xml`):

```xml
<!-- MISSION THREADS -->
<t id="100">Stella Invicta</t>
<t id="101">A series of missions from the Stella faction.</t>
```

## Step 2: Create Mission Groups Definition

Create or modify `libraries/missiongroups.xml` to define your mission group:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<diff>
    <add sel="/missiongroups">
        <!-- Stella Invicta mission group -->
        <group id="stella_invicta" name="{999840,100}" story="true"/>
    </add>
</diff>
```

### Attributes:

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `id` | Unique identifier for the group (used as `missiongroup.<id>`) |
| `name` | Text reference for the display name (e.g., `{999840,100}`) |
| `story` | Set to `"true"` for story missions (appears differently in UI) |
| `faction` | Optional: Associated faction (e.g., `"argon"`) |
| `enemy` | Optional: Enemy faction for war-related groups |

## Step 3: Reference the Group in Missions

Add the `group` attribute to both `create_offer` and `create_mission` elements:

### In create_offer:
```xml
<create_offer cue="Start_Mission"
    actor="$MissionContact"
    location="$OfferStation"
    type="missiontype.plot"
    group="missiongroup.stella_invicta"
    name="'Mission Name'"
    description="'Mission Description'"
    faction="faction.argon" />
```

### In create_mission:
```xml
<create_mission cue="Mission_Accepted"
    group="missiongroup.stella_invicta"
    name="'Mission Name'"
    description="'Mission Description'"
    type="missiontype.plot"
    faction="faction.argon"
    difficulty="level.medium">
    <briefing>
        <objective step="1" action="objective.flyto" text="'Objective text'" />
    </briefing>
</create_mission>
```

## Common Mission Group Examples

From the base game:

| Group ID | Display Name | Usage |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| `story_boso` | "Boron Mentor" | Boso Ta storyline |
| `story_hatikvah` | "Hatikvah Free League" | Reen storyline |
| `story_paranid` | "Paranid Conflict" | Paranid storyline |
| `terraforming` | "Terraforming" | Terraforming projects |
| `argon_police` | "Argon Police" | Argon patrol missions |

## Important Notes

> **Warning:** Do NOT use `create_mission_thread` for simple group titles. Mission threads create separate "Important" entries in the mission manager and are intended for complex multi-part missions, not just for grouping.

> **Tip:** The `group` attribute should be added to BOTH `create_offer` (for the mission offer screen) AND `create_mission` (for the active mission). This ensures the group title appears consistently.

## File Structure

```
extensions/your_mod/
├── libraries/
│   └── missiongroups.xml    # Mission group definitions
├── md/
│   └── your_mission.xml     # Mission scripts with group references
└── t/
    └── 0001.xml             # Text entries for group names
