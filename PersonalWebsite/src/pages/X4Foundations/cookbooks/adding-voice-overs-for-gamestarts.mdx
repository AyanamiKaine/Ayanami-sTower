---

We need to define a t file where the text can be found. Here we need to define the right page and text id, if we want to play a voice line we add the voice attribute. It then should search the voice/page_id/t_id.ogg file and play it.

## What files need to be added/changed

### SoundLibrary

You need to register the sounds found at a page so the game knows where to load them from

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<diff>
  <add sel="/soundlibrary">
    <sound id="999840_normal" description="Betty2" repeat="1" is3d="1" preload="0">
      <sample start="extensions\stella_x4\voice\999840\normal"/>
      </sound>
    </add>
</diff>
```

### VoiceSequences

You need to register which voice sequence corresponds to the id when playing a cutscene.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<diff>
    <add sel="/voicesequences">
        <voicesequence id="x4ep1_stella1_selected" page="999840">
            <delay time="1.0" />
            <speak line="600160" /> <!--the filename for the audio to play. Here it would be voice/999840/600160.ogg-->
        </voicesequence>
    </add>
</diff>
```

### t

Because voice lines have subtitles you also need to define them correctly.

Here they are defined in a 0001.xml file it is the default for all text ids if no specific language one is defined.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<diff>
    <add sel="/language">
        <page id="999840" title="Stella Mod" desc="Default language (english) text content" voice="yes">

            	<!-- GAME STARTS -->

            <t id="600110">Imperial Remnants</t>
            <t id="600120">After the gates closed our ambitious died too. Now it seems we finally found a way to open our gate again connectection us to our destiny to rule the galaxy. All citizens are called to witness this holy moment.</t>
            <t id="600160">After the gates closed our ambitious died too. Now it seems we finally found a way to open our gate again connectection us to our destiny to rule the galaxy. All citizens are called to witness this holy moment.</t>

        </page>
    </add>
</diff>
```

### Gamestart

In the gamestart the import part is the voice we define at the cutscene to play here `x4ep1_stella1_selected`

```xml
<diff>
  <add sel="/gamestarts/groups/group[@group='3']" pos="before">
    <group group="1000" name="Stella X4" />
  </add>

  <add sel="/gamestarts/gamestart[1]" pos="before">

    <gamestart id="x4ep1_stella1"
               name="{999840,600110}"
               description="{999840,600120}"
               image="gamestart_tutorial1"
               group="1000"> <!-- 999840 is the page id searched in the t file and 600110/600120 is the t id.-->
      <cutscene ref="gamestart_terran2" voice="x4ep1_stella1_selected"/>
    </gamestart>
     </add>
</diff>
```
