This guide explains how to create missions where you fight ships that are hostile to everyone, including their original faction.

## The Challenge

If you spawn an Argon ship owned by Argon:
1. It might not fight back (if you are friendly).
2. Police/stations will attack **YOU** for shooting their ally.
3. Relation boosts are **one-directional** and complex.

## The Solution: Ownership Transfer

Spawn the ship with the original faction (for proper loadout), then transfer to a universally hostile faction like **Pirates (Buccaneers)**.

### 1. Spawn with Loadout

```xml
<create_ship name="$RenegadeShip" macro="macro.ship_arg_s_heavyfighter_01_a_macro" sector="$Sector">
    <pilot><select faction="faction.argon" tags="tag.pilot" /></pilot>
    <loadout><level min="0.5" max="1.0" /></loadout>
    <owner exact="faction.argon" />  <!-- Argon for loadout -->
    <safepos value="$SpawnPos" />
</create_ship>
```

### 2. Transfer to Pirates

```xml
<set_owner object="$RenegadeShip" faction="faction.buccaneers" />
```

Now:
- Ship has Argon weapons (loadout generated before transfer).
- Everyone (Argon stations, player, police) attacks it.
- Ship attacks everyone (Pirates are universally hostile).

### 3. Extra Hostility to Player (Optional)

```xml
<set_relation_boost object="$RenegadeShip" faction="faction.player"
                    value="-1" decay="0" silent="true" />
```

## Advanced: Fight or Flight Behavior

### 1. Attack then Flee (Order Queueing)

```xml
<create_order object="$RenegadeShip" id="'Attack'">
    <param name="primarytarget" value="player.occupiedship" />
    <param name="pursuetargets" value="true" />
</create_order>

<find_gate name="$EscapeGate" space="$TargetSector" active="true" required="false"/>
<do_if value="$EscapeGate">
    <create_order object="$RenegadeShip" id="'MoveGeneric'">
        <param name="destination" value="$EscapeGate.exit.sector"/>
        <param name="endintargetzone" value="true"/>
    </create_order>
</do_if>
```

### 2. Panic (Low Health < 25%)

```xml
<cue name="Renegade_Panic">
    <conditions>
        <event_object_hull_damaged object="$RenegadeShip" />
        <check_value value="$RenegadeShip.hullpercentage lt 25" />
    </conditions>
    <actions>
        <cancel_all_orders object="$RenegadeShip" />
        <create_order object="$RenegadeShip" id="'MoveGeneric'">
            <param name="destination" value="$EscapeGate.exit.sector"/>
        </create_order>
        <speak actor="$RenegadeShip.pilot" line="10034" />
    </actions>
</cue>
```

> **Warning:** Do **NOT** use `instantiate="true"` for this kind of "one-off" trigger. Without `instantiate`, the cue triggers once and then is "complete".

### 3. Flee When Target Lost

```xml
<!-- Player leaves sector -->
<cue name="Player_Left_Sector">
    <conditions>
        <event_object_changed_sector object="player.occupiedship" />
    </conditions>
    <actions>
        <cancel_all_orders object="$RenegadeShip" />
        <create_order object="$RenegadeShip" id="'MoveGeneric'">
            <param name="destination" value="$EscapeGate.exit.sector"/>
        </create_order>
    </actions>
</cue>
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Ship has no weapons**: Spawn with Argon owner BEFORE `set_owner` to pirates.
- **Ship is idle**: Ensure pilot created with valid tag (`tag.pilot`).
- **Station doesn't attack**: Confirm ship is owned by hostile faction.
