This guide explains how to modify the health (hull) of ships and their components (engines, turrets, shields, etc.) using XML patching.

## 1. Modifying Ships

Ships typically define their hull directly with a `max` value in their macro file.

### Finding the Ship Macro
Use a search tool to find the macro file for the ship you want to modify.
Example: searching for "Nova Vanguard" might yield `assets/units/size_s/macros/ship_arg_s_fighter_01_a_macro.xml`.

### Vanilla Example
In the vanilla file:
```xml
<properties>
  ...
  <hull max="3100" />
  ...
</properties>
```

### Applying the Patch
Create a file in your extension folder mirroring the path of the original file.
**Path:** `extensions/stella_x4/assets/units/size_s/macros/ship_arg_s_fighter_01_a_macro.xml`

**Content:**
```xml
<diff>
  <replace sel="//hull/@max">4500</replace>
</diff>
```

## 2. Modifying Components (Engines, Turrets, Shields)

Components often use `integrated="1"`. This means the game calculates the hull value automatically based on the object's physical dimensions (volume). To set a custom, specific hull value, you must **disable integration**.

### Vanilla Example
In a typical engine macro:
```xml
<properties>
  ...
  <hull integrated="1" />
  ...
</properties>
```

### Applying the Patch
You need to change `integrated` to `0` and explicitly add the `max` attribute.

**Path:** `extensions/stella_x4/assets/props/Engines/macros/engine_arg_m_travel_01_mk1_macro.xml`

**Content:**
```xml
<diff>
  <!-- Change from integrated (calculated) to fixed value -->
  <replace sel="//hull">
    <hull integrated="0" max="5000" threshold="0.2" />
  </replace>
</diff>
```

### Important Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `integrated` | Set to `0` to manually define `max` hull. Set to `1` to let the game calculate it. |
| `max` | The total hit points of the hull. Ignored if `integrated="1"`. |
| `threshold` | (Optional) Defines the percentage of hull (0.0 to 1.0) at which the component is considered "critical" or may stop functioning correctly (e.g. `0.2` = 20%). |
