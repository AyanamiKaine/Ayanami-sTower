description: "Understanding which mod data can be reloaded without restarting the game."
---

Some data of mods can be reloaded simply by reloading a save or starting a new game. Some data can only be loaded via a restart of the client.

## What Can Be Reloaded

| Data Type | Reload Method |
|-----------|---------------|
| Mission Director (MD) scripts | Save reload / New game |
| AI Scripts | Save reload / New game |
| Text/Localization files | Save reload |
| Construction plans | **New game only** (baked into saves) |
| Ship/Station macros | Client restart |
| Wares definitions | Client restart |
| UI Lua scripts | Client restart |

## Quick Reload Workflow

For MD script development:

1. Make changes to your `.xml` files
2. Load a save game (or start new game)
3. Changes take effect immediately

## When You Must Restart

- Adding new ship/station macros
- Modifying ware definitions
- Changing UI lua scripts
- Modifying index files

## Tip

Keep a save game at a convenient location for testing your MD scripts. This allows rapid iteration without waiting for a new game to initialize.
