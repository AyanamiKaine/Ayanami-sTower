This document lists common errors and their solutions.

## Invalid SoundID - No definition found in SoundLibrary

**Error Message:**
```
Invalid SoundID "hash(XXXXXXX)" (soundidext={lineID}) on macro: "character_XXX_macro"! No definition found in SoundLibrary.
```

**Cause:** The game cannot find the voice line audio because the sound library entry is missing or incorrectly configured.

**Solution:**
1. Add entry to `libraries/sound_library.xml`:
   ```xml
   <sound id="{pageID}_normal" repeat="1" is3d="1" preload="0">
     <sample start="extensions\your_mod\voice\{pageID}\normal"/>
     <volume start="1.212" distance="0.090"/>
   </sound>
   ```

2. Ensure audio files are in the correct location:
   ```
   voice/{pageID}/normal/{lineID}.ogg
   ```

3. Files must be in **OGG format**, not WAV or MP3.

## Engine destruction event not firing

**Symptom:** `event_object_destroyed` or `event_object_hull_damaged` doesn't trigger when shooting engines.

**Cause:** Large ship engines often become "wrecked" (0 hull) rather than being destroyed/removed.

**Solution:** Use `event_object_hull_below_function_threshold` with `ship.maxspeed` check:
```xml
<conditions>
    <event_object_hull_below_function_threshold object="$Ship"/>
    <check_value value="event.param.isclass.engine"/>
    <check_value value="not $Ship.maxspeed"/>
</conditions>
```

## Property lookup failed

**Error Message:**
```
Property lookup failed for 'something' on object
```

**Cause:** Trying to access a property that doesn't exist on the object type or the object is null.

**Solution:**
1. Use `@` prefix for null-safe access: `@$object.property`
2. Verify the object exists before accessing: `<do_if value="$object">`
3. Check that the property name is correct for the object type

## No corresponding listeners (signal_cue_instantly)

**Error Message:**
```
No corresponding listeners for signal_cue_instantly
```

**Cause:** Using `signal_cue_instantly` to signal a child cue that isn't active yet.

**Solution:** Use `signal_cue` instead of `signal_cue_instantly` when signaling child cues from parent actions.

## Pink Checkerboard Texture

**Symptom:** Ships owned by custom faction have pink/purple checkerboard texture.

**Cause:** Missing paint theme mapping in `themes.xml`.

**Solution:** Add entry to `libraries/themes.xml`:
```xml
<diff>
  <add sel="/themes/theme[@id='painttheme_race_default']">
    <group faction="yourfaction" paintmod="paintmod_0002" />
  </add>
</diff>
```

## NPCGenerator not found

**Error Message:**
```
NPCGenerator not found for faction 'yourfaction'
```

**Cause:** Custom factions don't have NPC definition files.

**Solution:** When spawning pilots or staff, use a vanilla faction for selection but set owner to your custom faction:
```xml
<pilot>
    <select faction="faction.argon" tags="tag.pilot" />
</pilot>
<owner exact="faction.yourfaction" overridenpc="true"/>
```

## Offer not appearing

**Symptom:** `create_offer` executes but mission doesn't appear in Mission Offers.

**Causes & Solutions:**

1. **Missing `location` attribute**
   ```xml
   <!-- WRONG -->
   <create_offer cue="MyCue" actor="$Contact" ... />

   <!-- CORRECT -->
   <create_offer cue="MyCue" actor="$Contact" location="$Station" ... />
   ```

2. **Actor not properly initialized**
   - Ensure `set_entity_traits entity="$Actor" missionactor="true"` is called

## Mission objective shows "Invalid Target"

**Cause:** Setting objective to an NPC that has no physical location.

**Solution:** Use two-step objectives:
1. First objective: Fly to station
2. Second objective: Talk to NPC (set after player docks and NPC is placed)

## Variables not accessible in child cues

**Cause:** Variables created inside `<do_if>` blocks are scoped to that block.

**Solution:** Create important variables in the parent scope before conditionals:
```xml
<actions>
    <!-- Create here, not inside do_if -->
    <create_cue_actor name="$Contact" cue="this" ... />

    <do_if value="someCondition">
        <!-- $Contact is accessible here -->
    </do_if>
</actions>
```

## Cue only triggers once

**Cause:** Missing `instantiate="true"` attribute.

**Solution:** Add `instantiate="true"` to cues that should trigger multiple times:
```xml
<cue name="RepeatingCue" instantiate="true">
    ...
</cue>
```
