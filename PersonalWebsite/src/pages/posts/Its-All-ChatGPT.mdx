# Its All AI

More and more is see how online people accuse others of using ChatGPT or creating AI art. The problem is I don't think people can actually determine reliably if a Large Lange Model was used to create content. I personally dont use any LLM to create my art or my text. You would probably know that because of the weird idioms, mistakes and bad art. Much of my text and art has a certain style like a signature.

But just seeing one text or one artwork is simply not enough to infer that signature. While many people believe that certain LLM add [watermarks like an Em-Dash](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43758730). I simply think that its not yet possible to reliably accuse others of the use of AI with just glancing at the work created.
