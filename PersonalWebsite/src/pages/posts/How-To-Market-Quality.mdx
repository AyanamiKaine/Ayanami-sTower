A [new Paradox Interactive DLC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3315520/Crusader_Kings_III_Coronations/) gets released and obliterated in the reviews. Nothing new to see. But it got me thinking. Not the quality was used to market it, instead its quantity was used. 
- New activity you can do.
- Oaths you can take.

You may argue what else should they have said? Maybe that most of the features are bugged? Nah. Thats not my point. Its just an interesting observation.

# How to Value Something?

My friend values games not by the quality of time he spent with the game but instead the absolute amount of time spent. A rule of thumb of his is 1$ spent for each hour played. If he spents 60 bucks but plays only 30 hours he would see it as money wasted.

The thing is my friend uses absolute time spent not because he thinks that its the best way of doing it. He thinks its just easier to determine. Just think about it yourself. How would you determine the quality of an hour spent doing something? How much dopamine you had? How much you laught? In reality quality cannot be quantified. The result is that people cant use it to market something.

But they can market things as getting your moneys worth not in terms of quality but absolute time spent with it. Maybe most people just want to spent some time and the quality is not that important.
