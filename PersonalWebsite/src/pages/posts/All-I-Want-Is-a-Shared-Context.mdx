summary: "I dont want a globally shared datastructure or a database that connects to all my programs. Instead I want a shared context between all of them."

There already exists a shared context and that is the OS environment or we could argue the internet as a 
whole is also a shared context.

I invisoned it as a way to send messages to programs but every program could see and react on the message
send to the program because it was passed through the shared context. 
Yes its an event bus alla [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) or [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) 

But they are mostly created for distributed programs that do not run on the same 
local machine. The sad part is there exists multiple ways we can 
send events to processes but their are cumbersome to use.
