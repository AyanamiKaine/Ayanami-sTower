Always when I see Raku code and write my self some, I always feel like there are design decisions that are crazy at first but later make so much sense.

## The Sigil

A sigil in Raku determines how a variable should be treated. In JavaScript, we can write 

```js
let hello = () => Console.Log("Hello, World!")
```

```js
let hello = "Hello, World";
```

In Raku we explicitly have to say that hello is a function using the sigil `&`

```raku
my &hello = sub { say "Hello, World!" }
```

```raku
my $hello = "Hello, World";
```

Sigils are a concept I only know related to Ruby, and know that they do exist also in Perl 5 but work a little different. For more on Raku sigils read the [doc](https://docs.raku.org/language/variables#Sigils).

The C2 wiki has some [great discussions](https://wiki.c2.com/?TheProblemWithSigils) about some problems others have with sigils.
