Simulation games that strive to simulate larger living worlds, where one action can casscade into another creating intresting moments, are always something special.

I always wondered how did they do it? How much is faked, where the placer believes a complex simulation is happening and instead it was nothing more than hard-coded?

## How Dynamic is Gothic?

## A-Life 2.0

The first Stalker games featured a system that simulates npc routines for all npcs in the game. Even if that npc is at the other end of the map. Npcs could loot, attack others from different factions. Leaving loot for the player or the next npcs.

The player could stumble upon two factions fighting because by coincidence the path of them crossed.

Essentially npcs have pre defined routines, where to patrol, when to eat, sleep, etc. At release at now its praised as giving a good illusion of a living world.

The same [cannot be said for Stalker 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1gx1sds/i_have_tested_alife_20_for_10_hours_straight_3/). So what happened? The devlopers stated that A-Life 2.0 is there but simply bugged and not working correctly.

In A-life 1.0 there where to modes a online and offline mode. The online mode was related to things close to the player where the offline mode handled the AI outside the players vision i.e. every other AI logic on the game.

Its debateble that they implemented the offline part of A-life, we know they implemented the online part from experience and developer comments.
