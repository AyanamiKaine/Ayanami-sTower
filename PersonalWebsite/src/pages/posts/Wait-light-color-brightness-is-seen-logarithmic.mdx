While I was working on refreshing my fundamental knowledge about painting I came across a short text section saying that light is seen logarithmic and not linear so we shouldn't paint values linear. And I was like what do you mean its logarithmic. How didn't I learn this sooner?

A much better approach is halving values instead of a linear step-down.

- Linear:      100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, 0%
- logarithmic: 100%, 50%, 25%, 12.5%, 6.25%
