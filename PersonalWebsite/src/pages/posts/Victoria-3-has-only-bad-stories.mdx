While playing the new dlc for Victoria 3 and completing 3 runs.
I came to the conclusion that Victoria 3 has only bad stories to tell.

And sadly I really mean it. The thing that kept me playing was not an interesting
story that developed but green number goes up. At the same time I got quite angry
at paradox.

## The Game is now Worthy to be Called Version 0.8 (When you buy some of its dlc...)

When Victoria 3 released, it was simply not done cooking, IT WAS RAW. It was obvious from the start
that many of the major systems needed a great overhaul. They needed to be basically reimpleted
because not the balancing was the problem but its fundamental design.

Its obvious even playing now that the game is simply not complete. There are still systems in place like 
how war as a diplomatic crisis escalates and how a war is executed. Having a war is simply not fun. 

We could now argue how not being at war is a good thing (economically speaking) and should therefore be avoided
as a best strategy for your nation. But that misses the point of giving the player options to tell a story.

Maybe paradox didnt want to compete with Hoi4 on that regard.

Especially conducting war and war operations has so many edges you will cut yourself. From bad automatic
army deployment to wars that and because you didnt watch one province and now your war exhaustions grows too fast
even though your nation as a whole is completly fine, your army is winning and you would reconquer it in 2 weeks...

Victoria 3 has the ability to show that your nation cannot fight anymore. Strikes, rebellion, economic collaps, but
instead is uses one abstract value called "war exhaustion" to determine if a war should automatically end.

## But do the DLCs Improve the Game?

Not all but *[Sphere of Influnce](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2411231/Victoria_3_Sphere_of_Influence/)* and the latest dlc *[Charters of Commerce](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3450170/Victoria_3_Charters_of_Commerce/)* are a great addition. But as they are a great addition
to the game they also come with addtional salt. Why is this not the base game? Why do I have to pay over
100â‚¬ for something that I still cannot call a 1.0 worthy release?

And people will say than dont buy it. You dont have to pay anything! Bla bla bla. Missing the point entierly.
I was promised by fans, content creators and paradox itself that it will only takes some months and one dlc/expansion
until most of the edges are shaved off and the game is mostly fixed and a worthy 1.0. They lied. If I had known that
I would have refunded the game.

I bought an expectation and feard that if I hadnt bought it it would have never got any updates at all. An 
Imperator Rome all over again. I love economic games how could I not support it?

## Grifters and Liars

When you also watch some pardox content by other youtubers, they seldom mention the problems with the DLCs
its always the same narative. Yes I saw some problems, ecounterd bugs here and there. But that was two weeks 
ago on an built. When I raised the problem they said they will fix it. 

But the story ends always the same, the dont fix the problems, the DLCs becomes the worst rated every, people
are in open arms, etc.

Influencers are complicent in the scummy behavior of paradox. They basically do free marketing for paradox 
but dont even get paid. One reason that plays in that behavior is the abusive relationship fans have with
paradox. The same applies for content creators that rely on the game getting updated and not dropped. Imagine
not being able to make your weekly dev diary video, guide, review, or lets play of the new hot content.

All this results in an incentive for content creators to look the other way.

## The Abusive Relationship with Paradox and its Fans

There is a huge incentive for fans to support paradox interactive and buying its dlc's. 
If we buy them we can expect content updates for free. Basically the game gets iterated and
improved along many years, a quick look to Europa Universals 4 (now at version 14), Hearts of Iron 4 ,Stellaris (now at version 4), Crusader Kings 2/3
and ofc Victoria 3 are now at a much, much better state and full of different content (mods excluded).

If we dont support paradox and buy their dlc, their game will get some patches but will never reach 
its full potential. Yes I am look at you Imperator Rome. When you buy a paradox game, its seen as an
investment. 

Sadly paradox gets more and more sloppy. One dlc after another that is simply dog shit. Adding content
no one asked for, trying to sell a dlc but with less content than before. And people have angst. 
"I mean yea the dlc is bad but come on they will fix it! and if we dont buy it they may stop developing the game!
Then no good content will ever come and the current things wont get fixed!"

Its a vicious cycle. One of the worst ever developed dlc gets dropped. People are in disbelieve how could this happen!
Why is it so buggy? Didnt someone test this before? Poeple are buying the dlc. Paradox issues a 
statement how sorry their are and how this will never happen again. Then it happens again for the next 
paradox game. Usually the next dlc after being dog shit is significantly better.
