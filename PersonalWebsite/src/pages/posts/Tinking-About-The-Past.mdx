# Change in Feeling

I think that people today value what was in the past in smaller steps. Before they may cared what happend centuries ago, then years ago, then months ago. I knew that we have many biasies. One prominent example is the [recency bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recency_bias).

But it feels like the recency bias becomes stronger with each day. More information travels more quickly each day. There is not one day where nothing controversial happens. In the past you wouldnt be able to event get that information. In the past decades, its at your finger tips.

If its true that the past doesnt matters anymore because it can be replaced by a recent event in no time, what would that mean? How would we act if what we do in the present and future has little impact on the future itself. Would that mean we cant build on a past foundation anymore? I don't know.
