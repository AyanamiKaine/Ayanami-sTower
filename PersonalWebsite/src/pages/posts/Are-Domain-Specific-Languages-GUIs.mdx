summary: "While reading a book by Martin Fowler about Domain-Specific-Languages (same name as the book), I wondered if interacting with a GUI app is a form of Domain Specific Language."

I always found domain-specific-languages facinating the ability to model a solution to a problem in the 
language of the domain, seems like a really powerfull idea.

While reading the opinions of others especially regarding lisp and its ability use macros to create DSLs.

But man do some people hate DSLs, "everybody just creates their own little language that I have to learn."
