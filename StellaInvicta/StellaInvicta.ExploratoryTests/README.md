## Explority Tests

This project houses a collection of exploratory tests specifically designed for the game `Stella Invicta`.

**Important Notes:**

- **Expect Breakage:** These tests may break at any time as the game evolves. They are not guaranteed to be updated in sync with the latest game state.
- **Design Focus:** The primary purpose of these tests is to facilitate exploration and inform design decisions, highlighting areas that may require further attention.
- **Not Exhaustive:** Explority tests are not meant to be a comprehensive test suite or replace other forms of testing.
- **Living Documentation:** They serve as a record of past, current, and potential future design decisions, providing valuable context for the development team.

### How to Use:

- **Reference & Inspiration:** Use these tests as a reference point for understanding the game's mechanics, potential interactions, and design considerations.
- **Identify Design Gaps:** Explore the tests to identify areas where the game's design might be unclear, incomplete, or in need of refinement.
- **Experiment & Iterate:** Feel free to modify, extend, or create new exploratory tests to experiment with different design ideas and iterate on the game's mechanics.
