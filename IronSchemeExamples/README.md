## Here we explore some IronScheme
- Its a scheme(99% correctly implemented as call/continuations cant be correctly implemented in .Net) with great .Net interop.


## Critique
There is like 0 documented examples, the creator says to simply use grep to find use cases of certain symbols. This is quite problematic as he says that to how can I interop with .Net. This is intresting as the library [Bike](https://github.com/Lovesan/bike) for common lisp .Net interop seems to always work great (and has examples)

This brings me the question, should i even bother?
