# Stella Wiki

In this wiki we go over certain aspects of the Astra Aeterna project. My pet project. A 4x grand strategy game that is heavily inspired by past games like Homeworld 1, Crusader Kings, Master of Orion 3 (yes the hated one), and many more paradox games.

In design, we go over certain design aspects of grand strategy games. What my problem is with "modern" grand strategy design and possible solutions to them.

Engine is all about the game engine how to write mods and extend the overall game.

The lore section goes over the game worlds lore I have created.
