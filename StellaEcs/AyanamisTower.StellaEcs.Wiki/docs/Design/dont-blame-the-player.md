# Don't Blame The Player

We have a tendency to blame other and always see their faults. In game design this can result in the following. We start blaming the player for playing the game wrong.

Critique: "The game feels tedious, and some game mechanics seem pointless."

Response: "Ehmmm actually they all do have a point you simply don't see it, and probably you are using them wrong. Didn't you read the guide and wait you didn't play the tutorial? My guy it's your own fault for not understanding the game and playing it wrong."

When a player complains don't write it off or take every word by its direct meaning. Every criticism opens the gate for research why the player would critique it. Think about that with honesty.
