# Don't Blame The Player

We have a tendincy to blame other and always see their faults. In game design this can result in the following. We start blaming the player for playing the game wrong.

Critique: "The game feels tedious and some game mechanics seem pointless."

Response: "Ehmmm actually they all do have a point you simply dont see it, and probably you are using them wrong. Didnt you read the guide and wait you didnt play the tutorial. My guy its your own fault for not understanding the game and playing it wrong."

When a player complains dont write it off or take every word by its direct meaning. Every critism opens the gate for research why the player would critique it. Think about that with honesty.
