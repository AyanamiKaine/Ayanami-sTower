# Why do Some Decisions by Game Designers Later Anger Players?

We all know it, or experienced it our selves. A new patch is announced with huge changes. Most players are concerned, offer feedback, and think the changes will be improved. The patch lands, most players hate it. How is it possible to release a new bad patch/content to players that already are invested in your game and like it?

## The Disconnect Between Players and Developers

A player plays a game like he wants to. A developer develops the game like he wants the player to play it. Most players don't create their own games.

There will always be a pull between how the developers wishes the game to be and the players. I don't believe you can create the game that satisfy everyone. A simple rule to follow is give the players options to modify the game in ways it fits his wishes of the game. Modding support is key here.

A developer should always play his own game religiously, he should be the one with the most interest in making the game fun. He can only really know if its fun when he plays it. There is no other way around it. [It comes down to eating your own dog food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food).

And never forget [don't blame the player](/docs/Design/dont-blame-the-player)
