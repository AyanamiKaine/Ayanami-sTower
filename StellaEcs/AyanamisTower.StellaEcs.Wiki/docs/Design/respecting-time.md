# Respecting Players Time

There is one thing that needs to be respected at all time. Its the time a player invests. He wants to see progression that is meaningful in any way. Resetting the progession of a player insits long term hate.

Roguelites do it right because here each run results in progession that carries over to each new run. 

The best new game + modes are those where you not only carry stuff over but can unlock totally new things. In Dark Souls 2 there were better version of old items and completly spells to unlock. In Starfield (I know its not that good of a game) you can solve (I believe just one quest can be solved that way and the beginning of the main quest can be skipped) in a different way because you did the quest in the first run and your character cannonically carries that over.

Another good example of these meta progession is horizontal progression often found in MMOs like Guild Wars 2 and Runescape.

A bad example would be vertical progression like its done in WoW. Here each new expansion somewhat sunsets the old one. A player starting on the new expansion will not experience the old content. In a certain way something that is still available becomes so obsolete that taking it away is no different from how it is now.

A form of *meta progession* is always a fantastic way to honor time invested. But that does not give an excuse the take something away from the player. **As a developer always give, never take away.**
