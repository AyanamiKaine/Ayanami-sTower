# Be Bold

A choice between 15% bonus damage done by you with a 10% increase in damage taken by you and a choice between 100% more movement speed but 50% reduced carry capacity is easy to see.

One choice is being bold one choice isnt.

Ask yourself what is the more interesting choice? It will be the bold one. **Bolds choices are interesting choices.** Be bold.
