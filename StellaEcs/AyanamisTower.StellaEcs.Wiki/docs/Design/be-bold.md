# Be Bold

A permanent choice between 15% bonus damage done by you with a 10% increase in damage taken by you and a choice between 100% more movement speed but 50% reduced carry capacity is easy to see.

One choice is being bold one choice isnt.

Ask yourself what is the more interesting choice? It will be the bold one. **Bolds choices are interesting choices.** Be bold.

## Example

In the strategy games of the [Endless franchise](https://store.steampowered.com/developer/AmplitudeStudios) many factions work with constraints. A faction that cant declare war and has enhanced diplomatic options. A faction that cant trade, A faction that cant be at peace, etc. Those are bold choices. Being only additive is not bold. In many paradox games instead of having bold restrictions they have different additions you can get. 

In a game like Stellaris this often means having 15 menus and 7 mini-games to navigate. Because each faction is only unique in their numbers and flavour. It does not matter if a faction/race cant live on planets but only in space habitats if the mechanics are simply not different enough and only really matter in flavour.

Flavour is important but it should not the main selling point. Many dlcs are marketed as new content but in reality they are a new form of flavour of the same thing.

There are three different kinds of flavours.Think of game flavor like ice cream. Vanilla and Chocolate are both ice cream, but they offer fundamentally different experiences. [Blue Smurf](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlumpfeis)/[Blue Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_moon_(ice_cream)), however, is just vanilla with food coloring. It looks distinct on the surface, but underneath, the taste is exactly the same.
