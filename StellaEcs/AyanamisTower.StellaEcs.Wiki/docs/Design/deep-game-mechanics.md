# Deep Game Mechanics

# Defining Deep Game Mechanics

Deep game mechanics can be summarized with, it's a game mechanic that changes the way we interact and see the game world and have a profound effect on them. In [Crusader Kings III: Roads to Power](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2671070/Crusader_Kings_III_Roads_to_Power/) a new way to interact with the game world was introduced become and play an adventure. Adventures are deeply integrated in the game world itself. Every realm can interact with them and every adventure can interact with every realm. This strongly deepens the game mechanic. Now imagine instead they implemented a new government type that gives a new way to interact with the realm and character in that regions with said government, with new resources, buttons to press... I think you get my point. Having 30 similar ways to interact with something getting only minimal results from said interactions is not a deep mechanic.
