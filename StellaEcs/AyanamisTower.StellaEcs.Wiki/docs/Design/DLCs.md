# DLCs

I believe every DLC should expand the game, and each new interaction for the player should be added in two ways. A free version shows a simpler abstracted away interface. A paid version that enables the detailed abstraction. This enables us to patch the game with new mechanics. Make them available to all. And give the player a reliable option to disable them. With that he can mix and match the way which interactions the player want to see and use. If the player does not like a detailed spy system, he does not need to buy it or to enable it. He instead can work with a simplified version.
