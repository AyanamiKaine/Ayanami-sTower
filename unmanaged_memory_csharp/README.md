# Unmanaged Memory in C#

Here I am exploring how we can manually manage memory in C#. Its an exploration in how much can we use C# similiar too C++ in cases where performance matters.

## Things I want to explorer
- [ ] Implementing an Arena Allocator. (I did implement a really simply arena allocator for C and it was a much better alternative then using malloc and free, from a cognetive perspective.)
