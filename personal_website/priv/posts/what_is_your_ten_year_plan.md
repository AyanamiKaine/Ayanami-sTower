I was seeing a talk from Alan Kay ony youtube, watch them all they are really good and will challange your world-view in many points. But there is one thing that really stood out to me and that is the ten year plan.

When you want to solve a problem in 5 weeks you will be limited to a incremental solution you will look in the past and look for solutions that already existed and how you can use them. In essence this is incremental improvement. But now imagine you have 10 years to solve your problem. You will find solutions that where never done before. Manly because so many ideas sound crazy when you have no information on how to implement them.

Explain the idea of having a big plan over ten years. 10 years are not that much.
Thinking what you can do with a 10 year horizon! Learning painting and having an exibition of your work! Create your own programminig language that is nothing like any other language seen before! With 10 years you can bring ideas from the future to the present. With 10 years you can avoid incremental improvement and do much larger jumps that where not incrementally possible.
