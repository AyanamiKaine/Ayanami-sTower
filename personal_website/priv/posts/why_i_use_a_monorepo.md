## Why did i choose a monorepo?

I wanted to facilitate reuse not only in code but in design, and idea too. I wanted a central place where i can refrence solutions to problems. It opened up the possiblity of seeing a specific problem in a more generic way. For me it makes it easier to develop generic language agnostic solutions.
