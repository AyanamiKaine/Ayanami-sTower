## When Should You Start Using/Building an Abstraction?
- When you encounter the same pattern twice you should start thinking about it how it could be made into an abstraction.
- When you see that you use a pattern thrice implement an abstraction for it.
    - This could also be a bit extendended to, if you do something trice implement a way to automate it. (As there is a high likelyhood that you will do it again and then save time)
