## Nature Of Order Experiment

Here we experiment with the idea of centers, that are built recursivly from other centers. We can think of them as objects built from objects. The difference from an object in an OOP language and a center is the fact that a center has a position in space that cannot be destroyed via transformation i.e. compilation. Languages like ruby and js come close but are missing crucial abstractions. In ruby everything is an object. But we must go further, a program is an object, computation itself is an object, source code is an object. etc. The name object is misleading, because it assumes clear boundaries and the focus 

## Relations

- Centers are related to Entity-Component-Systems
- Centers are related to the actor model of computation
- Centers are related to the flow-based programming.
