# Todo

## Implement Jolt Physics (3D)

Instead of writing our own 3D physics framework we want to use an existing one. Jolt is a good and battle tested physics engine for 3D.

## Implment Box2D Physics (2D)

Instead of writing our own 2D physics framework we want to use an existing one. Box2D is a good and battle tested physics engine for 2D.

## Implement C# Scripting

C# has great scripting capabilities (Only the tooling is a bit lacking).

Capabilities should include:

- The ability to define and register new components.
- The ability to create and modify entities.
- The ability to create and modify systems.
