## Regarding Scripts

While I really really like the idea and implementation of the scripts. Being able to reload/refresh the UI while the app is running, sadly the bad tooling of C# Scripting Support throws quite a wrench into it. Bad and wrong error messages, incomplete knowledge of what types are available, terrible debugging experiences. The thing is if we now abandoned it, it wont get improved.
