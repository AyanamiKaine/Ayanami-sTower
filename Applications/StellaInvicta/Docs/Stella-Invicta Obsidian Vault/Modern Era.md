## Modern Era

## Limiting Resources

The current raw resources are being stretch tin. Economic growth slowed down dramatically. The galaxy is rather static. All cards have been dealt eons ago, the deck never shuffled. But now with the unknown reaches being ripe for colonization and exploitation. All existing factions must cope with the fact that if they dont fight for their existence they might become obsolete or left behind. 

### The Breaking of Isolation

Twenty years ago, the cosmic storms that had isolated the [[Firstborn-houses]] finally dissipated, allowing them to discover they were not alone in the universe. This revelation shattered their worldview but strengthened their resolve to claim what they saw as their rightful place as the galaxy's rulers. They began a rapid campaign of modernization and expansion.

### The Rise of Commerce

The [[Golden-Exchange]] established itself as the backbone of interstellar commerce, creating a vast network of trade routes and economic dependencies. Their golden fleet became the primary means of transporting goods between civilizations, even those at war with each other. Their neutrality and economic power made them both valuable and concerning to older powers like the Firstborn Houses, who remained suspicious of such dependency.

The more shadowy [[Obsidian-Market]] developed in parallel, trafficking in goods and information too sensitive or illegal for the Golden Exchange's open markets.

### The Discovery of Void Lines

The [[Void-Trader]]s discovered and mastered the mysterious Void Lines, shortcuts through space that dramatically reduced travel times between distant systems. This discovery transformed galactic transportation and warfare, though the strange whispers that affect those who travel these routes remain a disturbing mystery.
