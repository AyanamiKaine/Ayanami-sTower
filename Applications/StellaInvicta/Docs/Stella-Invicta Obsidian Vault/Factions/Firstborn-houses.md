#Faction
## Summary
- Somewhat modeled after Qing China their decadents and slow technology advancements. 
- Isolation, they dont participate in the golden exchange and dont profit from it. At least in the beginning.

## Notes
- I would really like it when we added some kind of **national anthem** for each faction.

# National Anthem (The Celestial Hymn)

## National Anthem of the Firstborn Houses

### Verse 1

First to emerge from void's embrace, Children of stars, the chosen race. Ancient bloodlines, proud and true, The cosmos bends to our virtue.

### Chorus

Firstborn Houses, divine by right, Celestial wisdom, eternal light. Through isolation's veil, we persevere, For galactic dominion, our destiny clear!

### Verse 2

Five Celestial Houses, standing tall, Bound by tradition, we answered the call. No longer confined by cosmic storms, We claim the stars as rightful lords.

### Chorus

Firstborn Houses, divine by right, Celestial wisdom, eternal light. Through isolation's veil, we persevere, For galactic dominion, our destiny clear!

### Bridge

Our towers reach beyond the sky, Genesis Records tell no lie. Ancient ways, preserved with care, Our birthright to rule beyond compare.

### Verse 3

The veil has lifted, our path revealed, With ancestral honor, our fate is sealed. A thousand worlds await our decree, Firstborn reign for eternity.

### Chorus

Firstborn Houses, divine by right, Celestial wisdom, eternal light. Through isolation's veil, we persevere, For galactic dominion, our destiny clear!

### Outro

Hear our anthem across the stars, The Firstborn march to claim what's ours. By blood and honor, we lead the way, For the Celestial Houses shall forever reign!

## Lore

### Firstborn

The firstborn houses are the first beings emerging from the dark void of space. Because of various storms in the south they where unable to explore more of the galaxy **mostly believing they are alone**.

This formed an understanding that they are the first created sentient beings and have some higher form of live. Because of thousand years of stagnation even though they are much older as a species they are not that much more technology advanced.

### Stagnation

Confined in their own space. As a result of their limiting resources they didn't advance much in time. They are by far the most populous faction in the galaxy, but their technology is rather primitive. 

### A bright future

The storms in the south fated 20 year ago, know the firstborn houses banded together to claim their rightful rule of the galaxy.

Their goal is to advance as much as possible in a short time to no longer stay behind.

## Societal Structure

The Firstborn Houses are organized into a rigid hierarchical system of noble houses:

- **The Five Celestial Houses** - The oldest and most powerful bloodlines who trace their lineage directly to the "First Emergence"
- **The Ascendant Houses** - Secondary nobility who gained prominence through military achievements or economic contributions
- **The Foundation Houses** - Lower nobility responsible for administration and specialized knowledge
- **The Bound Houses** - Vassal houses who serve the higher orders, often managing resource extraction and production

## Cultural Traditions

### The Genesis Records

The Firstborn maintain meticulous genealogical records called the "Genesis Records" - ancient scrolls and data crystals documenting bloodlines since the First Emergence. These records are sacred, with dedicated scholar-priests who maintain them.

### Ritual of Ascendance

When storms isolated them, the Firstborn developed elaborate ceremonies where nobles would meditate atop their tallest structures, gazing into the cosmos to commune with their "celestial ancestors." This tradition evolved into a rite of passage for nobles coming of age.

### Technological Conservatism

Their technology stagnated not just from resource limitations but also from cultural beliefs. Innovation came to be seen as disrespectful to ancestral ways, with technology preserved rather than improved. Their ships maintain ornate, ceremonial designs even when function would suggest otherwise.

## Post-Isolation Crisis

### The Great Awakening

When isolation ended, the discovery of other advanced civilizations created three factions within Firstborn society:

- **Traditionalists**: Believe contact confirms their divine right to rule and advocate immediate conquest
- **Reformists**: Push for rapid technological advancement and selective cultural adaptation
- **Isolationists**: Argue for renewed separation to preserve cultural purity

### The Mandate Council

A new governing body formed after isolation ended, bringing together representatives from each major house to determine their galactic strategy. Sessions are marked by elaborate ritual and fierce debate.

### Technology Acquisition Program

Despite public rhetoric about inherent superiority, the Firstborn have established secret missions to acquire advanced technology. These operations are disguised as diplomatic envoys but function as industrial espionage.

## Relationship with the Unknown Reaches

The discovery of the Unknown Reaches has particular significance to the Firstborn. Ancient temple carvings depict regions beyond the "celestial barrier" (now understood to be the Cosmic Veil). Some scholars believe their ancestors may have explored these regions before the isolation.

Exploration teams are now finding artifacts within the Unknown Reaches bearing symbols remarkably similar to ancient Firstborn script, creating profound theological debates about whether they truly were "First" as their creation myths claim.

## Military Doctrine

Despite technological disadvantages, the Firstborn field massive armies through sheer population advantage. Their warriors follow a code called the "Celestial Disciplines" - martial arts and battle tactics passed down for generations.

Their ships, while outdated, are numerous and operated by crews willing to sacrifice themselves for house honor. This creates a military doctrine focused on overwhelming force rather than tactical superiority.

## Structures

**Dynasty Towers** - Each of the major Firstborn Houses maintains a towering spire on their homeworld, with height proportional to lineage age. The oldest towers stretch beyond the atmosphere, requiring specialized breathing apparatus for visitors to the upper levels.
