## High Committee Strategist, [[Unified-Remnant-Collective|Unified Remnant Collective]]

### Date: AS 5248, Day 173

The Committee meeting ran long today. I sit now in my quarters aboard the _Red Vanguard_ - hardly the flagship of a mighty armada as our broadcasts claim, but a competent vessel nonetheless. The brandy helps with the headache that always follows these sessions. Alexei grows more ambitious by the day, and the strain of maintaining our grand illusion weighs on us all.

Today's crisis centered on the Kalenov System. We've claimed it as a "vital industrial center" for nearly three years. In reality, it's an unremarkable system with a single habitable moon that we've never even set foot on. Now, the Golden Exchange has scheduled a trade delegation to visit within two months, expecting to see the massive shipyards we've fabricated in our economic reports.

I argued for abandoning the claim - admitting a "strategic redeployment" of our resources elsewhere. Sonya and Pavel were with me. But Alexei and the others voted to double down on the deception. We're now committing a third of our actual resources to construct a Potemkin shipyard on Kalenov's moon - just enough to fool visitors who will be kept at a careful distance. The facades will be demolished the moment the delegation departs, the materials repurposed elsewhere.

Such is the absurd theater we perform daily. I sometimes wonder if there's a point where the lie becomes too big to maintain. Yet somehow, we keep expanding it.

The Voroshilov Incident last month should have exposed us. A Void Trader vessel strayed into what we claim is our most productive mining colony. In reality, it's an empty rock we've never visited. We scrambled to deploy atmospheric contaminants and holographic projectors to simulate activity from orbit. The fact that this desperate gambit worked only emboldened Alexei further.

Most disturbing is how our propaganda has taken on a life of its own. Yesterday, I reviewed reports from our operatives in the border worlds. Three independent settlements have declared themselves "Collective Territories" without any direct involvement from us. They've adopted our symbols, our rhetoric, even our fictional five-year plans. They believe in the glorious Collective that doesn't exist, and they're working to build it. Sonya found this hilarious. I find it unsettling.

And then there are the recruits. Young idealists arrive weekly at our actual bases, having traveled great distances to join the cause. They believe every word of our manufactured history. Some have even brought "family relics" they claim date back to the pre-Silence federation we invented. The conviction in their eyes when they speak of "restoring what was lost" is enough to make even me momentarily believe our lies.

The most troubling development is the Ancient Archive we're supposedly excavating on Remnov Prime. This complete fiction has taken on such importance that actual archaeologists from the Eternal Spire have requested permission to assist. We delayed, claiming security concerns, but they're persistent. Alexei has ordered the construction of a fake dig site with manufactured artifacts. More resources diverted to maintain the illusion.

I joined this venture for profit and perhaps a measure of power. I never expected to become the architect of a fictional civilization. Yet here I sit, night after night, crafting the next chapter in our imaginary history, designing industries that don't exist, and planning victories in battles never fought.

The irony is that our lie is becoming increasingly real. The seven of us now effectively govern three systems and influence several more. Our small fleet grows monthly. The taxes and tributes flow in. Perhaps in another decade, we might actually control half the territory we claim. But will that be enough? Or will the maps have expanded to claim half the galaxy by then?

Alexei speaks of legacy now. He talks about the Collective outliving us all, becoming what we pretend it to be. Perhaps that's possible. Or perhaps tomorrow will bring the investigator who sees through it all, and our grand illusion will collapse like the house of cards it is.

Either way, the Committee meets again tomorrow. Another crisis to manage, another lie to tell. I will be there, glass in hand, helping to build our empire of smoke and mirrors. What choice do I have? I've seen how the Committee deals with dissenters.

I should destroy this journal. Its discovery would mean my end. Yet I keep writing. Perhaps I need one place where the truth exists, even if no one ever reads it.

Tomorrow, we expand the lie further. For the glory of the Collective that isn't.
