# FSRS Sharp (Based on the python 5.1.3 version)

Here we simply translate the python version of fsrs ([py-fsrs](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/py-fsrs)) to csharp. Its as close as it gets to the python API. Dont expect something fancy. One reason we are doing it so we can simply turn it into the same json representation and load it as a dictionary in python. They should be compatible. The same tests are implemented. A big diviation from the python version should be seen as a bug.
