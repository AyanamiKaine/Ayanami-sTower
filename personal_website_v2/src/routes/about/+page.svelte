    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Interlude</h2>
    <p class="mt-2">I started learning programming as a self-taught developer because of my fascination with the computer. My favourite programming language is Common Lisp and I personally use Linux <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/de/workstation/" class="text-blue-800">(Fedora)</a> as my daily OS.</p>

        <li>C++</li>

    <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-600">By "proficiency", I mean that I know how to set up the programming environment, understand what makes the language unique, can create projects, and have already created several practice projects in these languages.</p>

    <p class="mt-2">In my free time, I enjoy programming, playing tabletop RPGs with my friends, painting and reading. You would wounder how much art and craftsmanship have in common with writing programs.</p>
