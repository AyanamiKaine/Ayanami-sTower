# Stella Invicta Headless

Here we implement the various simulation 4x features that dont need direct player interaction.

## Goals

The simulation must be vast, fast and dynamic.

I want that the player can destroy the economy of an empire without waging war.

Empires, must rise and fall with reason.

## Inspirations

- X4: Foundations
- Victoria 2
- Crusader Kings 2/3
- Endless Legend
- Player Driven Economies found in MMOs like Eve Online
