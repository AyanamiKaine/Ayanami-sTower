### Cultural Exchange and Influence

- The **Symphony of Stars'** Great Song subtly influences nearby civilizations, including segments of the **Verdant Dominion**, creating diplomatic tensions as some view this as cultural infiltration.
- The spiritual philosophies of the **Silentium Collective** find adherents in the bureaucratic halls of the **Unified Directorate**, particularly among those seeking escape from constant noise and chaos.
- The emergence of the **Firstborn Houses** from isolation has triggered a galaxy-wide fascination with their ancient artifacts and cultural practices, creating a market for authentic and counterfeit Firstborn goods.
