## The Great Silence: A Galactic Cataclysm

Approximately five thousand years ago, a cataclysmic event known as **The Great Silence** swept across the galaxy. This event is interpreted differently by various factions:

- To the [[The-Eternal-Spire]], it was a period of catastrophic knowledge loss, prompting their ancestors to establish the Spire as a repository of wisdom to prevent future collapses.
- For the [[Silentium-Collective]], it represents a mythological golden age of cosmic tranquillity that they seek to restore.
- [[The-Symphony-Of-Stars]] believes it was a time when the galaxy's harmony was disrupted, and their Great Song was established to restore balance.

This event reshaped galactic civilization and established the ideological foundations that would define future conflicts.
