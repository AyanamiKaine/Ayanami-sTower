- The galaxy must be really dynamic.
- When you do a Timelapse the galaxy should change. You see this terribly done in Vic3 as its game map seldomly changes in radically ways.
- Empires must fall and rise.
- The player must have the ability to change the galaxy in radical ways.

## Static vs Dynamic (Emergent Gameplay)

There is a major problem in all new paradox games. And that problem are event chains. Many new paradox games implement certain railroaded missions/events that need to be performed in a certain order to accomplish something.
- HOI4: **Focus Trees**
- EU4: **Mission Trees**
- Imperator Rome: **Mission Trees**
- CK2/3: **Event Chains**
- Stellaris: **Event Chains** | **Mission Trees(They are planned to be implemented in the future)**

These systems give you often goals you must achieve to progress. You must conquer province X, nation y cannot exist, and many more Boolean conditions.

What is the problem?

1. They need to be hand crafted, the result is it takes LITERAL YEARS for good quality content to be developed. If time is skipped the quality drops from a cliff.
2. Permutations: The more concrete Boolean conditions and flags are implemented. The more Boolean conditions need to be accounted for by new content. This usually results in more bugs as a certain combination of new set of things that can happen break the system itself. Good examples are EU4 and HOI4. Where new updates always break existing content because they forgot to account for a new set of permutations that where introduced. You cant even blame them. In the beginning certain nations could been only in 2 states, later they add things like a nation can still exists in exile (As done in HOI4), now this new condition needs to be accounted for in ALL UPCOMING CONTENT.
3. They limit ways the player can experience a set of events. If an event chain has two meaningful outcomes once experienced they loose their overall narrative meaning the player develops.
