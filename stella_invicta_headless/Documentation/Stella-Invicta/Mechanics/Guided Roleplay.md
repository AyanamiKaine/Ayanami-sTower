We dont want to say to the player "if you start role playing you will start having fun!". Most players dont enforce a specific rule set that ensures that the player plays a role. Instead we provided restrictions and open other ways for specific mechanics that organically means that the player plays a specific role. 

For example playing a colonizer that is xenophobic against already existing life. You could role play as one. Or we give the new population a harsh malus against already existing life meaning that the population will rebel, is unhappy, etc. this means the player will try to exterminate the life as its natural way of doing it. Do make this more dynamic and ensure diversity we can say that the [[Kryll-Imperium|Kryll]]
are xenophobic and the [[The-Symphony-Of-Stars|Sonari]] are xenophile and getting big bonuses when engaging with already existing life. 

Those negative and positive bonuses must be meaningful. This means as the [[Kryll-Imperium|Kryll]] you cant simply live with already existing live and cant think what are 10% less happiness? Its just a number. 

A great example of this approach would be `Endless Legend`
