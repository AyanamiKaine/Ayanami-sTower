## Mechanics

### The spire

The spire is a massive structure spanning multiple star systems. Connecting them together in a form of super highway. Making it incredibly fast to travel from end to end. The spire also works as a form of habitat. It has great defensive and is truly a mega structure in the universe. It holds vast amounts of un explored vaults of ancient knowledge. While many of the keepers believe they are simply here to guard them from others. Some believe the vaults should be open and their knowledge be used.
## Lore

The Eternal Spire is defined by its namesake. They are a faction centered around a colossal, ancient structure – the Spire – and are driven by the imperative to understand, preserve, and perhaps even _become_ like the Spire itself: enduring and unchanging in the face of cosmic time.

### Reverence for the Spire

The Spire isn't just a structure; it's the focal point of their culture, religion, and society. It's revered as a source of wisdom, a link to a lost age, and perhaps even a sentient entity or a conduit to something greater than themselves.

### The Spire's Genesis (Lost to Time) 

The Spire itself is of unknown origin. Was it built by their ancestors, or did they discover it? Is it technological, biological, or something else entirely? Its age is immense, potentially predating known galactic history. The Spire may predate their species as they currently exist, implying they evolved or were altered in its vicinity

### The Great Silence (or The Sundering, The Collapse)

A cataclysmic event in the distant past is a central part of their mythology – "The Great Silence," "The Sundering," "The Collapse of Voices"—a period of galactic-scale upheaval, societal collapse, or technological regression. They believe the Spire was created before or during this event, perhaps as a repository of knowledge to survive it.

### Knowledge is a Resource to be Defended

They still value knowledge above all, but now they see it as a _precious resource_ constantly under threat. Not just from entropy or time, but from actively hostile forces – those who would destroy knowledge, misuse it, or hoard it for themselves.

### History 

Solara and Lunara now just the [[Dual-Kingdoms-Of-Solar-And-Lunara]] once tried to harness the knowledge of the spire for their own rivalry. Where mostly demolished and beaten by the Eternal Spire. The Eternal Spire sees both of them as great threats to knowledge itself. They have proven not to be capable of using technologies and protecting it. Only using it for the selfish gains. Even now the formation of the dual kingdoms is nothing more than a selfish desire to take revenge. They must be stopped...
