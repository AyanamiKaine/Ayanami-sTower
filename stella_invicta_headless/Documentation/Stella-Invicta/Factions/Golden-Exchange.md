## Special Mechanic

### The golden fleet.

The golden exchange is all about logistics, trade and making profits. The golden exchange can use its trading fleet to cargo goods from all places for a much cheaper price. In general is it cheaper to let the golden exchange cargo your trade goods.

What is the drawback? Dependency should the golden exchange be disrupted entire supply lines could collapse. 

## Lore

### MONEY, MONEY, MONEY

While the golden exchange only occupies 4 systems their position and ideology stands of everything goes for money gave them a huge economic boost. All other empires trade at the golden exchange because it acts as a middle men between empires that dont like each other or that are even at war.

While many factions see the value of the golden exchange the `Firstborn Houses` look down at them because of their vast power over others. The golden exchange is the backbone of the galactic economy and as the `Firstborn Houses` are not deeply connected to it they see no value in it.

### The Truckers of the Galaxy

There is no bigger transport fleet in the galaxy than the `golden fleet`.

Because of the desire to trade with as many and as freely as possible the `Golden Exchange` established themselves as THE logistic faction. While trading between factions is usually done by the factions itself. Not so for the golden exchange, goods coming and going in the golden exchange are exclusively transported by themselves. Entrenching the dependency on them.

### The opportunity of [[UnknownReaches|The Unknown Reaches]]

Maybe we could create a struggle for the golden exchange to establish themselves in the unknown reaches. This could result in either the golden exchange also controlling the logistics in the unknown reaches or another exchanging rising. Creating a rivalry and possibly disturbing their trade in their Home.
