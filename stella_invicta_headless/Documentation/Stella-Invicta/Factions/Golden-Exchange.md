### MONEY, MONEY, MONEY

While the golden exchange only occupies 4 systems their position and ideology stands of everything goes for money gave them a huge economic boost. All other empires trade at the golden exchange because it acts as a middle men between empires that dont like each other or that are even at war.

While many factions see the value of the golden exchange the `Firstborn Houses` look down at them because of their vast power over others. The golden exchange is the backbone of the galactic economy and as the `Firstborn Houses` are not deeply connected to it they see no value in it.

### The Truckers of the Galaxy

There is no bigger transport fleet in the galaxy than the `golden fleet`.

Because of the desire to trade with as many and as freely as possible the `Golden Exchange` established themselves as THE logistic faction. While trading between factions is usually done by the factions itself. Not so for the golden exchange, goods coming and going in the golden exchange are exclusivly transported by themselves. Entrenching the dependency on them.
