#Faction
## Summary
- Xenophile
## Special Mechanic

The symphony of stars has the ability to construct Resonating Instruments to increase the power of the great song, making its modifiers stronger and also influencing more factions outside its own reach. The [[Verdant-Dominion|Verdant Dominion]]  possibly found being influenced by it. Characters influenced by it should get a trait that reflects that. This should influence how they behave.

Should the great song extend to all reaches of the galaxy it can greatly buff all factions. Or if the great song is of sinister nature...

### The nature of the great song

The meaning of the song can be changed adding new verses or changing the text entirely. This changes the nature of great song meaning its influence is differently interpreted. Imaging changing the song to a more war like primitive nature. Now all characters influenced by it changed drastically in character. This would also change the name from The Symphony of Stars to maybe the War Orchestra of the doomed.

## Lore

### Concept:

Imagine a species whose entire society and government are structured around a complex, ever-evolving song. This isn't just music; it's their language, history, law, religion, and social structure all rolled into one vast auditory tapestry. `(DESIGN HINT: Something similar is done in the movie Arival, here the language of the aliens is based on symbols that transcend time)`

### The Sonari

A species with highly sensitive auditory organs, or whose brains are wired to process and interpret complex sound patterns in profound ways. They communicate primarily through modulated sound, even subtle vibrations. Visually, they could be unassuming, making their auditory abilities the defining characteristic.

### The Great Song

The origins of the great song are mysterious in itself. While many of the new parts are clearly documented the first and second verse meaning is unclear. Some think its simply a phrasing of life others believe it tells the true origin of the `Sonari`.

This is the central pillar of `Sonari` society. It's constantly being added to, reinterpreted, and performed. Think of it as a living, breathing constitution, legal code, and cultural epic all at once. Different sections of the Song represent different aspects of life: history, laws, moral principles, scientific knowledge, artistic expression.

### The Resonating Instruments

The `Sonari` created various mega structures used to produce sound in the everlasting void that is space. Its unclear how such devices can work, as they break the laws of physic, at least it seems that way...

Should these instruments cease to make music, no one knows what could happen. While many believe a long moment of silence utters the end of an era others believe their music keeps the creatures of the deep void away from the galaxy.

### The Choristers

A ruling council composed of the most skilled and respected interpreters and performers of the Great Song. These aren't just musicians; they are scholar-priests, judges, historians, and legislators all in one. Their authority comes from their deep understanding and ability to "speak with the Song."

### Song-Law

Laws are not written down but exist as melodic and rhythmic patterns within the Great Song. Disputes are resolved by Choristers interpreting the relevant sections of the Song and "performing" judgments through new musical additions or variations.
History as Harmony: History is maintained and transmitted through specific musical movements within the Song. Changes to the Song reflect societal shifts and new understandings of the past, though major changes are carefully considered by the Choristers.

### Auditory Culture

`Sonari` culture is deeply immersive in sound. Their cities are designed to resonate and amplify sound, architecture could be acoustically optimized, and daily life are filled with layers of subtle and complex auditory communication. Silence is considered unsettling or even dangerous.
Musical Castes/Guilds: Society could be stratified based on musical skill and knowledge of the Song. Different guilds or castes might specialize in different aspects of the Song - history keepers, law interpreters, artistic innovators, etc.

### "Dissonance" as Crime

Actions that disrupt the harmony of the Song or create "dissonance" in society are considered crimes. This could range from social missteps to violations of Song-Law.

## Structures

**Harmonic Resonators** - Planet-sized instruments that convert stellar radiation into sound waves, creating music that can be heard across entire systems. Each Resonator is tuned to complement the others, creating an ever-changing cosmic symphony.

**The Conservatory** - A hollow moon transformed into the greatest acoustic chamber ever constructed. Within its precisely engineered interior, compositions played by the Symphony's maestros create patterns of sound that manifest as visible light forms.
