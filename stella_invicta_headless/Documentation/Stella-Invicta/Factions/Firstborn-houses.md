## Lore

### Firstborn

The firstborn houses are the first beings emerging from the dark void of space. Because of various storms in the south they where unable to explore more of the galaxy mostly believing they are alone.
This formed an understanding that they are the first created sentient beings and have some higher form of live. Because of thousand years of stagnation even though they are much older as a species they are not that much more technology advanced.

### Stagnation

Confined in their own space. As a result of their limiting resources they didn't advance much in time.

### A bright future

The storms in the south fated 20 year ago, know the firstborn houses banded together to claim their rightful rule of the galaxy.

Their goal is to advance as much as possible in a short time to no longer stay behind.
