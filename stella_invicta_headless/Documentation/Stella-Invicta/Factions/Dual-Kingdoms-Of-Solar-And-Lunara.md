#Faction
## Lore

`This faction directly echoes the Austria-Hungary structure.`

### Faction Name

The Dual Kingdoms of Solara and Lunara (or perhaps the Solar-Lunar Diarchy, or the Concordant Kingdoms)

### Concept

Imagine an empire comprised of two distinct, powerful kingdoms, Solara and Lunara, united under a single Emperor, but each retaining significant autonomy in internal affairs.

### Historical Basis

Solara and Lunara were once bitter rivals but the exential threat of [[The-Eternal-Spire]] brought both Solara and Lunara to their bring of extinction. Because of the unique position of their home worlds they had no choice but to cooperate. 200 Years of war forged a new kind of alliance. When the king of Solara married the queen of Lunara. Bringing the vast armada of Solara and the resources and technology of Lunara together.

While the ruling houses might be now working together, their populations still remember the deep rivalry.

### Government Structure

The Emperor/Empress (Shared Monarch): Head of state for the entire Dual Kingdom. This figure controls overarching foreign policy, the combined military in major conflicts, and some shared imperial resources. However, their direct power within Solara and Lunara is limited in internal matters. The Imperial title is traditionally alternated between royal houses

### The Solar Kingdom (Solara)

Ruled by a King/Queen of Solara, with its own parliament/council handling laws, taxes, internal security, culture, and most aspects of Solaran life. This kingdom is more populous, and wields a much bigger fleet protecting Lunar.

### The Lunar Kingdom (Lunara)

Ruled by a King/Queen of Lunara, with a similar level of internal autonomy. This kingdom could be culturally distinct, more tradition-bound, resource-rich and more technologically advanced

### Joint Ministries (Limited)

Similar to Austria-Hungary, there might be a few joint ministries responsible for areas of mutual interest, like a "Diarchy Foreign Ministry" or a "Joint Military Council" - but these are likely to be points of friction and negotiation, reflecting the delicate balance of power.

### Societal Structure

#### Solaran Society

Describe the typical Solaran citizen, their values, social hierarchy, industries, cultural norms. Perhaps they are more meritocratic, focused on technology, and have a faster-paced society.

#### Lunar Society

Describe the typical Lunar citizen. Are they more traditionalist, agrarian, spiritually focused, or perhaps possess a strong warrior culture? Social structures might be more rigid or hierarchical.

### Tensions and Synergies:

The inherent tension is the potential for conflict between Solara and Lunara. However, there are also synergies. Perhaps Solara needs resources that Lunara provides, and Lunara benefits from Solara's technology and protection. Internal politics would revolve around navigating this delicate balance and managing the inherent rivalry.
