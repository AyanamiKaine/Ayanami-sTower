# No Modifiers

Modifiers are bad, a good example is Stellaris, and Civ 6. Here civilisations are mostly simple modifiers they dont change the game much. In stellaris you can choose many different forms of goverment and they dont radically change the game even though they should.

Modifiers dont allow for interesting decisions. Big concequences allow for interesting decisions. Avoid small modifiers, if modifiers are choosen make them big with big ups and big downsides.
