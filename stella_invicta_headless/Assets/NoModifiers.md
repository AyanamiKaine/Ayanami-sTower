# No Modifiers

Modifiers are bad, a good example is Stellaris, and Civ 6. Here civilisations are mostly simple modifiers they dont change the game much. In stellaris you can choose many different forms of goverment and they dont radically change the game even though they should.

Modifiers dont allow for interesting decisions. Big concequences allow for interesting decisions. Avoid small modifiers, if modifiers are choosen make them big with big ups and big downsides.

We dont need 10 cultures, religions, goverment forms when they play all the same.

There should be some form of synergy forming. Maybe when taking, culture, religion, goverement forms create some synergies how they interact creating a bigger positive feedback loop. Like becoming a trader of the golden exchange and being part of the void so you can travel the void lines. Beating your competition.
