# SDL 3 Raku Wrapper

## Why?

I wanted to learn more about Raku and I am always intrested in interactive with native code.

## Incremental Development

We will incrementally develop the wrapper, implementing an example one by one.

## Where the SDL3 library needs to be?

When you installed SDL3 on linux using your package manager of choice nothing needs to be done. If you want to distribute the library yourself. Always place the library in the working directory you call raku.
